Tasks Performed: 

         The first task involves logging into Microsoft Azure and identifying the specific Flight Delay experiment to be utilized for the project.Then  Azure Machine Learning is utilized to clean the flight dataset for exploration.The first task involves signing in to the Azure Machine Learning Workspace.The Flights Delay Data sample dataset is added to the experiment, and its contents are visualized to gain a preliminary understanding.Before exploring data, cleaning is performed by removing duplicate rows and replacing missing values.Duplicate rows are removed based on specific fields using the built-in Azure Machine Learning module. After removing the duplicate rows, replace missing values in the DepDelay and ArrDelay columns with the value 0 (zero).
                   
             A regression model is trained to predict a numeric value, such as the number of minutes a flight is delayed.Selecting the relevant columns required for training the regression model.Once selected then Editing metadata is done to categorize specific columns followed by Normalizing data for better model performance.Then we Add a Split Data module and use it to split the rows into 70% / 30% subsets.We then add a Boosted Decision Tree Regression module and a Train Model module.and training it with the 70% data splitA Score Model module is added, and use it to score the trained model using the 30% split of data.Finally evaluating the model's performance using the Evaluate Model module.
           
                     In summary, these activities involve logging into Azure, identifying and running experiments, cleaning and exploring the data, and training a regression model for predicting flight delays. Each step is documented with screenshots and explanations for inclusion in the project report.
